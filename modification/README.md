# Modification Tools

This is a small helper notebook that should hopefully assist with JSON modification.

It will additionally ensure a consistent format across all files.

It's currently WIP, just providing basic I/O functionality

## Use

Open the `modification.ipynb` notebook and run it. 

This notebook should provide some information on how to use the `JSONOntology` and `OntologyItem` classes.
