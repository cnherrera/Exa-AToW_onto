# Exa-AToW Ontology

This ontology models the core entities and relationships involved in the **Exa-AToW**  project (part of the NumPEX PEPR initiative), focusing on high-performance computing (HPC) workflows, resources, and user interactions.

The ontology is serialized in **Turtle (TTL)** format and can be used in **Semantic Web** applications and **Linked Open Data (LOD)** environments.

## üîç Ontology Concepts

The ontology defines key concepts for the ExA-AToW ecosystem:
(*Bold items indicate concepts that are under review*)
- **Job**: Represents computational tasks, job descriptions, submission metadata, scheduling attributes, and runtime behavior in HPC environments.
- **HPCResource**: Covers physical and virtual resources in HPC, including compute nodes, storage, interconnects, and infrastructure.
- **ProcessorIndicatorEstimator**: Groups estimation tools, metrics, and models used to assess processor indicators such as power consumption, thermal footprint, and die size.
- **PhysicalCharacteristic**: Captures physical and structural properties of HPC components like memory capacity, die size, material lifetime, and energy efficiency.
- **Workflow**: Encompasses workflow-related entities such as execution steps, workflow engines, orchestration strategies, and dependencies. Based on:  
  > Suter, F., et al. (2026). *A terminology for scientific workflow systems*. FGCS 174, 107974. [DOI](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.future.2025.107974)
- User: (TBD) Describes individuals or agents interacting with HPC systems, including identity attributes, roles, and behaviors.
- Authentication: (TBD) Models authentication concepts including credentials, identity validation, access protocols, and login activities.
- Digital Twins: (TBD)


## Ontology Contruction: For Exa-AToW partners! 
### `main_classes.json`
Describes each main concept (entity) in Exa-AToW. 

### sub_HPC_classes.json
  JSON file describing the HPC Resources main class. 
  Each area of the project should ahve a JSON filw with this information.

  **Each partners should fill the information needed for their field**

example of entry (if entry is in the correct json file, then no need to add the parent_class):
```
  {
    "id": "ComputeNode",
    "parent_class": "HPCResource",
    "pref_label": {"en": "Node","fr": "Noeud"},
    "comment": {
       "en": "A physical or virtual server that executes computational jobs within a partition.",
       "fr": "Un serveur physique ou virtuel qui ex√©cute des t√¢ches de calcul au sein d'une partition."
    },
    "equivalent": ONTOLOGY.Name,
  },
```
## Adding properties



## Adding instances
In the ontology we will only add fixed instances.
Example:
```
    {
        "instance_name": "InMemory",
        "class_type": "DataManagementStorage",
        "pref_label": {"en": "In-Memory", "fr": "En m√©moire"},
        "comment": {
            "en": "Data held in RAM.",
            "fr": "Donn√©es conserv√©es en RAM."
        }

```

Other instances can be defined afterwards, when describing specific elements of the project.

```
from ontology_generator import ExaAToWOnto

onto =  ExaAToWOnto()
onto.add_instance(instance_name = "instance_naame", class_type = "class_type", pref_label = "pref_label", comment = "comment")
```


## üìÅ Contents

- `exaatow-ontology.ttl`: Main ontology file
- `files/*.json`: JSON files describing each concept in the ontology, separated by classes.
- `docs/`: HTML documentation generated with Wicodo. (TBD)

## Recreation of the ontology in Python (rdflib)
This will be done at the project level. But if you wish to recreate the full ontology with additional information:
```
from ontology_generator import ExaAToWOnto

onto = ExaAToWOnto()
# we can add things here

onto.save_ontology("exaatoe_onto_vN.ttl", format="turtle")

```



## Visualization

To visualize the ontology:

- Use WebVOWL (through the ontology webpage generated with Widoco: XXXX)
- visualization tool in the Python file:
```
# After loading the ontology:

onto.visualize_graph(
    output_file="my_ontology_visualization.html",
    height="600px",
    physics=False  # Disable physics for static layout

# open the html file with a browser

```


## Ontology Concepts

Key classes include:

    HPCResource ‚Üí CPU, GPU, RAM, SSD, etc.

    AuthenticationEntity ‚Üí User, AccessToken, Session

    DieSize, Workload, MemoryCapacity as datatype-linked concepts
